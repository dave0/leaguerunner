	You must agree to the following waiver in order to activate your

While the sport of ultimate is understood to be a non-contact sport, this 
does not mean that contact does not occur. Ultimate is a fast paced, 
athletic sport, and as such has all of the attendant risks that are commonly
associated with such an activity. While all players are expected to adhere 
to the Spirit of the Game as outlined in the rules of the sport, it is not 
possible to absolutely ensure that contact between players will not occur, 
and that injuries will not be sustained. Members are reminded that they 
engage in the sport entirely at their own risk.
</p>
<p>
Given that OCUA offers the sport of ultimate at varied and dispersed 
locations, and does not have officials such as referees at the games, it 
falls to the Captains and players of the teams participating in the game to 
be responsible for the safety of the site at which they are playing. 
Captains and players are jointly responsible to examine the field of play 
before their game begins, to determine if it is safe.   They are responsible
for taking appropriate action if they feel that their safety is being 
compromised by playing on what they consider an unsafe field; this includes 
but is not limited to the refusal, as a team or individually, to play on a 
site they deem to be potentially hazardous.  OCUA never forces its members 
to play when they are not comfortable doing so; games can easily be 
rescheduled.
</p>
<p>
While participating in an OCUA sponsored game of Ultimate, all players have 
the duty to take reasonable efforts to ensure their own safety, the safety 
of their teammates, and the safety of the opposing players.  This includes 
but is not limited to the refusal, as a team or individually, to play 
against an opponent they feel is playing in an unsafe manner, and forcing a 
teammate to stop playing if s/he is alleged to be playing in an unsafe 
manner by a teammate or by a member of the opposing team acting in good 
faith.  Captains have the additional duty to discuss any safety issues with 
the Captain from the opposing team, where (a) a teammate requests that such 
a discussion be held; and/or (b) when the Captain deems that it is necessary
to do so.
