<p> 
Please respect the following rules for all fields.  Note that some sites also
have additional restrictions listed on that field's page that must also be
followed.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Garbage facilites do not exist at any site.  Do not leave any garbage
      behind when you leave -- even if it isn't yours.  Take extra care to
      remove any hazardous items (ie: bottlecaps, glass) to avoid injury to
      others.
  </li>
  <li>If dogs are not allowed at a particular field, you <b>must</b> respect
      this.  If dogs are permitted at a field, you must clean up after your pet
      and take the waste away with you.</li>
  <li>By law, alcohol is not permitted on any league field, including UPI. 
      Furthermore, posession of any alcoholic beverage at the following sites
      can and will lose us our ability to play there:  St. Paul's, Lynda Lane,
      Laurentian, Romulan, and any city or school field.  
  </li>
</ul> 
<p>Due to some individuals and
teams ignoring the rules, we are close to losing several of our fields.  If
fields are lost due to the actions of a particular player or team, they will
be <b>removed from the league</b>.
